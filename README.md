# CNC Linear Controller

This it the repository for a CNC Liner Contoller named "The Cheap Mechanical Controller".  It was inspired by a project located here:   http://www.cnczone.com/forums/arduino/215402-cnc.html#post1457414

The repository has these sub directories:

    code/ contains Arduino Sketch
    docs/ contains documents, BOM, images, etc..
    Eagle/ contains Eagle schematics
    
The sketch I am currently using is from the forum post listed above.  I am working on a sketch with some features needed for my application.
